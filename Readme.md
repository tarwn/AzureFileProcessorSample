Azure File Processing Sample
==================================

A common pain point I've run into in past projects in research, enterprise IT, and SaaS environments has been the last minute "please process 10 days worth of files in 1 day". Inevitably there is a moment when we do the math and realize that no matter how badly we need to hit our deadline, the process just physically won't complete in time. 

So I thought this would be a good exmaple of using PaaS platforms in many environments to turn a common pain point into a simple decision of how much money we are willing to spend to buy a sooner finish line.

The blog post for this sample is not posted yet but I'll post it when it is.

Running the Sample Code
----------------------------

Running the sample code locally on your own system has a few requirements:

* Visual Studio 2010
* Windows Azure SDK
* SQL Server
* ASP.Net MVC 3

You will also need to configure the compute and storage emulators that come with the Azure SDK: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg433134.aspx
