Azure File Processing Sample
==================================

A common pain point in past projects in research , enterprise IT, and SaaS environments has been the last minute "please process 10 days worth of files in 1 day". Inevitably there is a moment when we do the math and realize that no mater how badly we need to hit our deadline, the process just physically won't complete in time.

The blog post for this sample is not posted yet.

Running the Sample Code
----------------------------

Running the sample code locally on your own system has a few requirements:

* Visual Studio 2010
* Windows Azure SDK
